# Recruiting
 
## Methodology

1. Source. All Hiring Managers systematically source before we have slots to fill.

2. Select. We conduct structured interviews that rate candidates against the scorecard that we've created.

3. Sell. Finally, we persuade the best candidates to join our team.

## Scorecard 

The Hiring Manager creates a shared document that describes precisely what he/she wants the person to accomplish in the role. This is a set of outcomes and competencies that define a job. They must be both measurable and have an accomplish-by date

## On-Site Interviews

1. A Topgrading interview
2. Several Focused interviews

### Topgrading Interview

The goal of this interview is to understand the candidate's story and patterns. These stories and practices are predictive of the candidate's future performance. Start from the beginning and move forward chronologically. Create chapters of a job (or groups of jobs) that last 3-5 years. This interview should take about 2 hours (3 hours for a CEO, 1 hour for entry-level). It is worth the time. For every hour we spend Topgrading a candidate, we'll save 100s of hours not dealing with B or C players.

The script:

For each job or group of jobs (lasting 3-5 years).

1. What were you hired to do?
2. What accomplishments are you most proud of?
3. What were some low points during that job?
4. Who were the people you worked with? Specifically:
 i. What was your boss' name, and how do you spell that? What was it like working with him/her? What will he/she tell me were your biggest strengths and areas for improvement?
 ii. Who were your peers on the team, and how do you spell their names?
 iii. Who were the members of your team, and how do you spell their names?
 iv. How would you rate the team you inherited on an A, B, and C scale? What changes did you make? Did you hire anybody? Fire anybody? How would you rate the team when you left it on an A, B, and C scale?
5. Why did you leave that job?

### Red Flags:

Here are the things to watch out for during the interview process that signal problems:

- Candidate does not mention past failures.
- Candidate exaggerates his or her answers.
- Candidate takes credit for the work of others.
- Candidate speaks poorly of past bosses.
- Candidate cannot explain job moves.
- Their family doesn't want them to take this job.
- For managerial hires, the candidate has never had to hire or fire anybody.
- Candidate is more interested in compensation and title than in the job itself and _____.
- Candidate tries too hard to look like an expert.
- Candidate is not curious about us or others. (Candidate is self-absorbed.)

## Selection

1. Update all the Scorecards.
2. Rate each candidate.
3. If we have no A's, restart the process to step 2: Source.
4. If we have one A, we make them an offer pending reference interviews.
5. If we have several A's, we rank them and offer pending reference interviews to the best A from among them. We try to find another role at _____ for the other A's.

## Reference Interview

We do not skip the reference checks! The Reference Interviews are where we learn the truth about the candidate. These interviews give us by far the most accurate picture of the candidate's future performance

The script:

1. "In what context did you work with the person?"
2. "What were the person's biggest strengths?"
3. "What were the person's biggest areas for improvement back then?"
4. "How would you rate his/her overall performance in that job on a scale of 0-10? What about his/her performance causes you to give that rating?"
5. "The person mentioned that he/she struggled with ________ in that job. Can you please tell me more about that?"
